# Task 1- You have a list of integers: numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. Write a Python program to create a new list squared_numbers that contains the square of each number in the original list.

# Answer here
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
squared_numbers = [number **2 for number in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)

# Task 2- Given a tuple person = ("Adam Smith", 35, "Software Engineer"). Write a Python program to unpack the tuple into three separate variables: name, age, and profession.

# Answer here
person = ("Adam Smith", "35", "Software Engineer")
name = person[0]
age = person [1]
profession = person [2]
print(name, age, profession)

# Task 3- Write a Python code to create a list squares that contains the squares of all the even numbers in the range 1 to 20 (inclusive).

# Answer here
squares = [number ** 2 for number in range(1,20) if number % 2 ==0]
print(squares)

#Task 4- Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and groups them into two lists: one containing even numbers and the other containing odd numbers. Use list comprehension or loops to implement this grouping operation.

# Answer here
even_numbers = []
odd_numbers = []

for number in numbers:
  if number % 2 == 0:
    even_numbers.append(number)
  else:
    odd_numbers.append(number)
print(even_numbers, odd_numbers)

# Task 5- Suppose you have two lists

first_name = ["Adam", "Jane", "Bob"]

last_name = ["Johnson", "Smith", "Jones"].

Write a Python program to create a new list full_names that contains the full names by concatenating the corresponding elements from first_name and last_name

# Answer here
first_name = ["Adam", "Jane", "Bob"]
Last_name = ["Johnson", "Smith", "Jones"]

full_names = []

for i in range(len(first_name)):
    full_names.append(first_name[i] + "" + Last_name[i])
print(full_names)
